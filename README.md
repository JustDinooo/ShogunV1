# ShogunV1

Hello, my name is *Yessine Ben Tkhayat*. I'm a 3rd year networks and systems engineering student, and a cybersecurity enthusiast.
This is my first ever ruby on rails project **ShogunV1**

1. It contains sign up and a sign in forms
2. Once logged in you can use shodan service

**V1?**.. Yes you guessed it, **V2** will be available soon as I plan to enhance some features and add new ones. ðŸ˜‰
